# Coalesc3

This is our script patches library. It's used to recompile the scripts of the game we need to modify the scripting of.

## Configuration

First, you need to install python3, and pip install PyYAML.

Then, you need to create a `config.py` file based on  `config.py.sample`, and change the paths for your own setup.

Finally, run `python build.py`. The command has a help option if you need it.
